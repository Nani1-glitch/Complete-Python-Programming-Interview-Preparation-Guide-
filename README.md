## ✏️ BODMAS Rule

Learn how the BODMAS rule (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) applies to Python arithmetic operations.

## 🔄 Data Types and Conversion

Understand how to handle different data types in Python and how to convert between them.

## ✂️ String Slicing

Master string slicing techniques to extract specific parts of a string.

## ⚖️ Relational and Logical Operators

Get comfortable with relational operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.) and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) for decision making.

## 🛤️ Conditional Statements

Learn to write conditional statements using `if`, `else`, and `elif` to control the flow of your programs.

## 🔄 Loops

### While Loop

Explore the `while` loop for repeated execution of code blocks until a condition is met.

### For Loop

Dive into the `for` loop to iterate over sequences like lists, strings, and ranges.

## 🧵 String Methods

Discover various string methods for manipulating and processing text data.

## 🔄 Nested Loops

Understand how to use nested loops for more complex iterations.

## 🔄 Loop Control Statements

### Break and Continue

Learn how to control loop execution using `break` to exit loops and `continue` to skip iterations.

## 📚 Collections

### Lists

Work with lists to store and manipulate ordered collections of items.

### Tuples

Understand tuples, an immutable collection type, and their use cases.

### Dictionaries

Explore dictionaries to store key-value pairs and retrieve data efficiently.

### Sets

Learn about sets, a collection type that does not allow duplicate elements, and their operations.

## 🔧 Functions

### Basic Functions

Define and call functions to encapsulate reusable code blocks.

### Scope of Variables

Understand the scope of variables, including local and global variables.

### Positional and Keyword Arguments

Learn to use positional and keyword arguments in function calls for clarity and flexibility.

## 🔍 Built-in Functions

Explore some of Python's built-in functions for common tasks like finding the maximum, minimum, sum, and length of collections.

## 🔄 Map and Reduce Functions

Leverage `map` and `reduce` functions to apply operations across collections efficiently.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Thank you for exploring this guide! This comprehensive overview of Python basics is perfect for beginners and a great resource for interview preparation. Happy coding! 🎉
